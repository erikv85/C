# C Projects

Here I'll upload various C programs I've written. Most of them are very small, only made for trying out features of the language. It'll take me some time to upload what I have as most of it is very poorly structured (I only started with C programming ca. January 2017).

The code is as it was when it was handed in, but I have tried tidying up here and there. All Doxygen (or at least, Doxygen-esque) documentation was written several months after handing in (and passing) this exam.
